# M7 network foundation

M7.1 defines the shared contract consumed by parallel implementation lanes. See [`clean-slate-network`](../network/src/lib.rs) for the authoritative types.

## Layering

```text
VirtIO / raw NIC (NetworkLink trait)
        |
kernel net bridge + userspace network service (TrustedCaller, NetworkRequest IPC)
        |
Ethernet / ARP / IPv4 / ICMP  (#84)
        |
UDP (#124)  TCP (#125)
        |
DNS (#85)  TLS (#86)
        |
capability broker (#87)  acceptance (#88 / #89)
```

Linux socket ABI compatibility is deferred to M9. Application code uses Clean-Slate capabilities and bounded IPC, not POSIX sockets.

## Ownership map

| Issue | Location |
|-------|----------|
| #82 VirtIO net | `kernel/src/device/virtio/net.rs`, QEMU fixture in `xtask` |
| #83 network service | `service-fixtures/src/network_service.rs`, `kernel/src/service/net_bridge.rs` |
| #84 L2/L3 core | `network/src/{ethernet,arp,ipv4,icmp}.rs` |
| #124 UDP | `network/src/udp.rs` |
| #125 TCP | `network/src/tcp.rs` |
| #85 DNS | `network/src/dns.rs` |
| #86 TLS | `network/src/tls/` |
| #87 capabilities | `kernel/src/capability/network.rs`, `capability` crate |
| #88 / #89 acceptance | `kernel/src/selftest/m7_*.rs`, `xtask` |

## Capability vocabulary

Network capabilities use `ResourceClass::Network`. Rights are distinct from generic read/write and from raw NIC authority:

| Right | Gates |
|-------|--------|
| `NET_RESOLVE` | DNS lookups via the network service |
| `NET_CONNECT` | Open/bind/connect socket sessions |
| `NET_SEND` | Transmit on an open session |
| `NET_RECEIVE` | Receive on an open session |
| `NET_RAW_DEVICE` | Raw `NetworkLink` access (driver or network service only) |
| `DELEGATE` | Attenuated delegation to another holder |
| `REVOKE` | Revocation of derived network capabilities |

Missing capability vs missing right is surfaced to clients as distinct `NetworkError::Denied` reasons (`NoCapability` vs `MissingRight`).

## Buffer ownership

`FrameBuf` values are moved across contract boundaries. Failed `NetworkLink::transmit` returns the frame to the caller. Device and service code must not retain hidden aliases to caller-owned buffers.

## Session vs holder identity

`SessionId` is tagged with the network-service `SessionGeneration`. The kernel attaches `TrustedCaller { pid, domain, instance_generation }`; clients cannot supply trusted identity fields in `NetworkRequest` payloads.

## Request/response frames

Every `NetworkRequest` / `NetworkResponse` is one fixed 64-byte frame so it fits a single kernel IPC message (`IPC_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`). Consequences:

- `Resolve` names are bounded by `MAX_REQUEST_HOSTNAME_LEN` (55 bytes). DNS wire names up to `MAX_DNS_NAME_LEN` are parsed by the resolver lane only.
- `Send` / `Receive` frames carry byte counts only; payload bytes move through the bounded payload region owned by the network-service transport (#83), never inside the IPC frame.
- `NET_RAW_DEVICE` is a valid `Network`-class bit but the broker must never include it in an application grant; it exists so the driver/service side can hold explicit raw-NIC authority distinct from application network authority.

## Hermetic fixture

Constants live in `network/src/fixture.rs`. Acceptance assumes a private `10.77.0.0/24` lab network, fixed DNS answers, echo/TLS ports, and repository-owned certificates under `xtask/fixtures/m7/`. No public Internet, public DNS, external PKI, or host LAN dependencies.

## Deferred

- IPv6 and dual-stack policy
- IP fragmentation and reassembly
- VLAN tags and jumbo frames
- Multiple NICs and routing policy
- Linux socket ABI (M9)
- DNS-over-TCP and DNSSEC
- Arbitrary certificate stores / Web PKI

## M7.4a L2/L3 foundation

Issue #84 adds bounded parsers and a host-testable [`L3Stack`](../network/src/stack.rs) in `clean-slate-network` (no VirtIO types leak upward).

### Supported on-wire subset

- Ethernet II, 14-byte header, no VLAN; EtherTypes IPv4 (`0x0800`) and ARP (`0x0806`) only.
- ARP: hardware type 1 (Ethernet), protocol `0x0800`, 6/4 address lengths, opcodes request/reply only.
- IPv4: version 4, IHL 5–15 (options skipped, never parsed), header checksum verified (RFC 1071).
- ICMP: echo request/reply with checksum; other types parsed as `IcmpMessage::Other` or error shells without panicking.

### Fragmentation policy

Any IPv4 datagram with the MF flag set or a non-zero fragment offset is rejected with `ParseError::Fragmented`. The stack increments `StackStats::dropped_fragmented` and continues; reassembly is deferred (see **Deferred** above).

### ARP cache bounds

- [`ARP_CACHE_CAPACITY`](../network/src/arp.rs) = 16 entries; TTL in monotonic ticks via `ArpCache::new(ttl_ticks)`.
- On insert when full, the **oldest-inserted** entry (minimum `inserted_at`) is evicted.
- At most [`MAX_PENDING_ARP_REQUESTS`](../network/src/arp.rs) = 4 distinct unresolved IPs may have outstanding ARP requests; further lookups fail until cache space frees.
- `ArpCache::clear()` and `L3Stack::reset()` drop cache and pending state.

### `L3Stack` API

- `poll(now) -> Result<Option<Inbound>, NetworkError>` — one RX frame; handles ARP for our IP, ICMP echo to our IP, delivers IPv4 UDP/TCP to upper layers.
- `send_ipv4(now, dst, protocol, payload_len, writer)` — same /24 only (`SUBNET_PREFIX_LEN` = 24); returns `NetworkError::Unreachable` after emitting a bounded ARP request when MAC is unknown (caller polls and retries).
- `send_icmp_echo`, `reset()`, `stats()`.

Malformed frames increment `StackStats::dropped_malformed` and are not fatal.

### `Inbound` and offset helpers (#124 / #125)

Upper lanes consume:

- `Inbound::Ipv4(Ipv4Inbound { header, frame, payload_offset, payload_len })` — call `Ipv4Inbound::payload()` for bounded L4 bytes; `header.protocol` is `IpProtocol::UDP` or `TCP`.
- `Inbound::IcmpEchoReply { id, seq, payload }` for local ping clients (not the socket IPC path).

Layout helpers for writing into a [`FrameBuf`](../network/src/buffer.rs) before transmit:

- `stack::ETHERNET_HEADER_LEN` (14)
- `stack::STANDARD_IPV4_HEADER_LEN` (20)
- `stack::l3_payload_offset()` → 34 (Ethernet + fixed IPv4 header)

UDP/TCP modules should write L4 starting at `l3_payload_offset()` after the stack fills L2/L3 headers, or build on received `Ipv4Inbound::payload()`.

### Pseudo-header checksum (#124 / #125)

```rust
pub fn pseudo_header_checksum(
    src: Ipv4Addr,
    dst: Ipv4Addr,
    protocol: IpProtocol,
    payload_len: u16,
) -> u16
```

Defined in [`ipv4`](../network/src/ipv4.rs); combine with the L4 checksum per RFC 793/768.

### Teardown

`L3Stack::reset()` clears ARP cache, pending ARP tracking, stack statistics, and invokes `NetworkLink::reset()`.

## M7.2 VirtIO-net

Kernel driver: `kernel/src/device/virtio/net.rs` (legacy VirtIO PCI `0x1000`, I/O transport matching M5 block).

**Features negotiated:** `VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC` only. No mergeable RX buffers, offloads, control queue, or multiqueue.

**Queue geometry:** RX queue 0 and TX queue 1; each queue size must be a non-zero power of two (≤ 256 legacy max). The driver posts a bounded RX pool of 16 buffers (≤ `MAX_DEVICE_RX_QUEUE_DEPTH` 64). M7 acceptance uses legacy `virtio-net-pci` without host LAN attachment.

**RX pool:** 16 static slots × (12-byte buffer prefix + 1514-byte frame). Legacy RX completions report a 10-byte on-wire header prefix; Ethernet begins at offset 10. Descriptor ownership is `DriverOwned` or `DeviceOwned`; slots are never reposted while `DeviceOwned`.

**Poison / reset:** Malformed used-ring completions (unknown descriptor, descriptor not device-owned, length &gt; posted buffer, or length &lt; virtio-net header) are device-side protocol violations → `DeviceState::Poisoned`. Runt (&lt; 14 B) or oversized (&gt; 1514 B) Ethernet frames are peer-controlled and are dropped with the slot recycled, never poisoning the NIC. TX completion timeout → `ResetRequired`. `NetworkLink::reset()` resets the device, re-validates DMA, reposts RX buffers; failure → `Poisoned`. `VirtioNetDevice::release()` resets the PCI device, poisons local state and releases the single-instance DMA claim; `discover()` fails while another instance is live, so a replacement service can never alias device-owned descriptors.

**Hermetic fixture:** `cargo xtask test-m7-net-device` starts an xtask-hosted smoltcp peer (`xtask/src/m7_fixture.rs`) on `127.0.0.1:<port>`. QEMU uses `-netdev socket,id=n0,connect=127.0.0.1:<port>` (4-byte big-endian length-prefixed raw Ethernet). Guest device: `-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=n0,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56,disable-modern=on`. The peer answers ARP/ICMP for `10.77.0.1` and UDP echo on port 4000.

**Serial markers (ordered):** `[NET ] virtio ready mac=…`, `[NET ] tx ok len=…`, `[NET ] rx ok len=… from=52:54:00:ab:cd:ef`, `[NET ] reject oversized`, `[NET ] poisoned reason=…`, `[NET ] reset ok`, second TX/RX round trip, `[M7.2] PASS`.

**Run / debug:**

```bash
cargo xtask test-m7-net-device
```

Host peer logs: `[FIX ] arp reply`, `[FIX ] icmp echo`, `[FIX ] udp echo len=…`.

On Windows, set `OVMF_CODE` / `OVMF_VARS` (see `scripts/run-tests.ps1`) or run tests through that script; xtask only auto-discovers Linux OVMF paths.
